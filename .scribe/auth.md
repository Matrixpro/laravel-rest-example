# Authenticating requests

This API is authenticated by sending an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by registering a new account or log in with an existing one using the Auth API endpoints.
